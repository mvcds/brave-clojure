> Referential Transparency

Be able to change the function call by its return value without affecting the program because the function would return that exaclty value

> Side effect

A side effect happens when change within a function is observable outside of it

> Pure functions

1. Return the same result if given the same arguments (are *referential transparent*)
2. Cause no side effects

A pure function relies only on its own arguments and immutable values to produce its result
