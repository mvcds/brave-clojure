> Clojure and Java

1. Clojure applications are run the same way as Java applications.
2. Java is necessary for core functionalities of Clojure like reading files and working with dates.
3. Java already has a vast ecosystem of useful libraries and Clojure can benefit from using them.

> JAR files

A ZIP file with the JAR (java archive) extension.

Clojure programs are transformed in JARs due to the `java` command.

> The JVM

Your machine executes machine instructions regardless of the language you've used to write your program.

The same way, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) executes bytecode by translating it on the fly into machine code that the host understand throught a process called _just-in-time compilation_.

Java and Clojure programs are compiled to Java bytecode, packed in JAR files.

> Java interop

Writing Clojure code which uses Java classes, objects and methods directly
