> Shared access to mutable state

Clojure was designed to specifically address the problems related to shared access to mutable state

> Value

A single irreducible unit in a larger system.

Values cannot be changed e.g. adding 1 to 15 does not alterate the "value" of 15.

> Producing new values

A process applied to a value will produce a new value.

> Identity

A *name* we use to designate a succession of unchanging values produced by a process over time.

As an analogy, if _fred_ had a different phone number five years ago, it wouldn't matter how many time it has changed, we would still call those numbers "fred's phone number".

> State

The value of an identify at a point in time.

It is analog of receiving new data in the real world, just because it has changed it doesn't mean that in the past the value was not different i.e. time as a stream
