> Programming to Abstractions

An **abstraction** is like a named collection of operations. That's why `map` can handle vectors, sets, lists and more.

> Sequence

May refer to a collection of elements organized in linear order.

If the core sequence functions `first`, `rest`, and `cons` work on a data structure, you can say the data structure implements the sequence abstraction

* `first` returns the value for the requested node
* `rest` returns the remaining values after the requested node
* `cons` adds a new node with the given value to the beginning of the list

If those are implemented, you can use `map`, `reduce`, `filter`, and other seq functions on top of them.

> Indirection

A generic term for the mechanisms a language employs so that one name can have multiple, related meanings. For instance `first` has multiple, data structureâ€“specific meanings. Indirection is what makes abstraction possible.

Clojure also allows for **Polymorphism**. Polymorphic functions dispatch to different function bodies based on the type of the argument supplied.

> `seq`

It produces lists
